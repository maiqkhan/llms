      "1. **Familiarize Yourself with Key Concepts**: Module 1 often covers foundational topics such as Docker and Terraform. Make sure you understand virtualization concepts, containerization, and infrastructure as code.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Installation of Required Packages**:\n",
      "   - Ensure you have `psycopg2` installed if you're working with PostgreSQL. Use `pip install psycopg2-binary` or `conda` to install it.\n",
      "   - If you face issues, consider updating your `pip` or `conda` versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Docker Commands**: Understand how to build and run Docker images using `docker-compose`. Familiarize yourself with commands like `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose run`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Troubleshooting Errors**: Be prepared for potential errors such as `ModuleNotFoundError` for missing libraries. Read error messages carefully, as they often provide clues on what’s missing or misconfigured.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Utilize Resources**: Check the README files and course materials thoroughly for setup instructions and common troubleshooting steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Engage with the Community**: If you encounter problems, don't hesitate to ask questions in forums or groups related to your course. Fellow students or instructors may provide valuable insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "By staying organized and proactive in your learning, you'll be able to navigate the module more effectively.\n",
